        <h3>
          Non-Discriminatory Haar-Cascade classifier
        </h3>
        <p>
          + Built a non-discriminatory haar-cascade classifier implemented using OpenCV  in Python which uses an extensive dataset to train a facial recognition model.
        </p>
        <p>
        + Trained the model with a wide variety of positive and negative samples and deployed the cascade classifier as a .xml file.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Raspberry-Pi Object detecting module
        </h3>
        <p>
          + Built and deployed a 3.5 Inch TFT Raspberry Pi module to act as learning aid/disability aid.
        </p>
        <p>
          + Assembled and developed the module to be a pocket-sized aid to classify objects and generate voiceover for alt-text/image descriptions for detected objects.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Neural Network Library
        </h3>
        <p>
          + Wrote an extensible deep neural-network library using NumPy free from the abstraction-based overhead of libraries such as Keras, OpenCV, and TensorFlow.
